As part of my Programming for Data Science module, I took a closer look at the punctuality of commercial flights in the United States using R and Python programming. The goal was to go beyond the surface and uncover the patterns and connections hidden in the data. Using both R and Python allowed for a practical and comprehensive approach to understanding the complexities/trend of flight punctuality and what lies behind those delays.
