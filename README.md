As part of my Programming for Data Science module, I took a closer look at the punctuality of commercial flights in the United States using R and Python programming. The goal was to go beyond the surface and uncover the patterns and connections hidden in the data, putting into practice essential skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), honing my abilities in data cleaning, and offering an opportunity to apply regression techniques. Using both R and Python allowed for a practical and comprehensive approach to understanding the complexities of flight punctuality and what lies behind those delays. 

Grade attained: 70.
